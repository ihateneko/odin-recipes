    <p class="para">Rajma Masala or Red Kidney Beans Curry is one of the most popular curries made in North India. I love Rajma Masala so much but sure next to Chole Masala. But my family is not fond of rajma dishes so I always try different recipes to impress them. But this Rajma Masala Recipe has become one of my family favorite these days that hubby who has an aversion to rajma loved this gravy.

    <p class="para">Since my childhood I have tasted rajma only as sundal and in kurma and I always loved it. So when I started cooking I loved trying different recipes with Rajma especailly to make my family enjoy rajma. Rajma Paratha and Rajma Masala are the most family favourites.</p>
    
    <p class="para">I haven’t ordered Rajma Masala at restaurants but always taste it when I find it in any buffet menu. The urge to recreating a recipe that I tasted led to me to this Rajma Masala Recipe which has become a most demanding dish at home. You may ask…What is more special about this Rajma Masala Recipe ? It is the usual onion tomato based gravy right?! Yes I agree but the addition of blanched tomato puree and the slight difference in cooking method makes this Rajma Masala all the more special and tasty.

    <p class="para">Over the years I have learnt making a perfect tasting Rajma Masala where the beans is fully merged with the creamy gravy with a soft melt in the mouth texture. I do not like watery gravies much and this creamy Rajma Masala is my absolute favorite.
